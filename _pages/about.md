I am a graduating PhD student in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Stanford University and a member of the [Stanford Sustainable Systems Lab (S3L)](https://ramr.sites.stanford.edu/), where I am advised by [Professor Ram Rajagopal](https://profiles.stanford.edu/ram-rajagopal). I am interested in using tools from controls and optimization to address challenges related to demand-side flexibility, electrification, and DER integration in electric power systems. My most recent projects focus on developing predictive control strategies for grid-interactive residential water heaters. Check out my [publications](https://ebuech.github.io/publications/) and [research projects](https://ebuech.github.io/portfolio/) for more information about my work.

During graduate school, I have been supported by a Stanford Graduate Fellowship and a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship. I received my M.S. from Stanford University in 2019 and B.S. from Tufts University in 2017, both in Mechanical Engineering. I was also previously a research intern at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), working on residential building simulation and energy systems modeling.
