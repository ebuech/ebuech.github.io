Residential electric water heaters have significant load shifting capabilities due to their thermal heat capacity and large energy consumption. Model predictive control (MPC) has been shown to be an effective control strategy to enable water heater load shifting in home energy management systems. In this project, we analyze how modeling tank stratification in an MPC formulation impacts control performance for stratified electric water heaters under time-of-use (TOU) rates, using both experimental validation and simulations. This project involved:

- Developing a novel water heater MPC formulation designed to capture the stratification patterns observed in two-element resistive water heaters. The formulation was designed so that it is convex, computationally tractable, and physically implementable on real-world water heaters.
- Developing a parameter identification method for the proposed controller model and validating it using real-world measurements.
- Designing a [laboratory testbed](https://ramr.sites.stanford.edu/lab-facilities) with the sensing and measurement capabilities to validate different control strategies under realistic conditions.
- Performing extensive real-time tests of different controllers using the laboratory testbed and simulations to compare their performance.
