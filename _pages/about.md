I am currently an AI Control Theory and Optimization Scientist at [PassiveLogic](https://passivelogic.com/).

I received my PhD in Mechanical Engineering from Stanford University in 2024. At Stanford, I was a member of the [Stanford Sustainable Systems Lab (S3L)](https://ramr.sites.stanford.edu/). My research focused on using tools from controls and optimization to address challenges related to demand-side flexibility, grid-interactive buildings, electrification, and DER integration in electric power systems. Check out my [publications](https://ebuech.github.io/publications/) and [research projects](https://ebuech.github.io/portfolio/) for more information about my graduate school research. 

I previously received my M.S. from Stanford University in 2019 and B.S. from Tufts University in 2017, both in Mechanical Engineering. I was also previously a research intern at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), working on residential building simulation and energy systems modeling.
