I am currently a PhD Candidate in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Stanford University. I am a member of the [Stanford Sustainable Systems Lab (S3L)](https://ramr.sites.stanford.edu/) where I am advised by [Professor Ram Rajagopal](https://profiles.stanford.edu/ram-rajagopal). I am broadly interested in controls, optimization, and machine learning for power and energy systems. My current research focuses on demand-side flexibility, load modeling, residential electrification, and DER integration. 

Previously, I obtained my M.S. degree from Stanford University in 2019 and B.S. degree from Tufts University in 2017, both in Mechanical Engineering. I also was a research intern at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) working on residential building simulation and energy systems modeling.
